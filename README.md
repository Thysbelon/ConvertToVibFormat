# ConvertToVibFormat
A batch script that takes all audio files in the current folder, converts them to Audio CD wav with VLC, then compresses them with chdman. This allows the audio files to be loaded into DuckStation as disc images, so they can be played with Vib-Ribbon.
To download, click on the green button on the top that says "code", then click "Download Zip". Please unzip the file before running it.
